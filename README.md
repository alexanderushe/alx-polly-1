# Security Audit and Remediation

This document outlines the findings of a security audit performed on this codebase. It details the vulnerabilities that were discovered, their potential impact, and the steps taken to remediate them.

## Vulnerabilities Discovered

### 1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in `deletePoll`

*   **Vulnerability:** The `deletePoll` function in `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts` allowed any authenticated user to delete any poll, regardless of ownership.
*   **Impact:** This could lead to unauthorized data loss and disruption of service.
*   **Remediation:** The `deletePoll` function was updated to include a check that ensures the user deleting the poll is the owner of the poll.

### 2. Information Leak in Authentication

*   **Vulnerability:** The `login` and `register` functions in `app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts` returned specific error messages from Supabase, which could be used for user enumeration.
*   **Impact:** This could allow an attacker to determine which email addresses are registered in the system.
*   **Remediation:** The error messages in the `login` and `register` functions were replaced with generic messages, such as "Invalid credentials" and "Could not create user".

### 3. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `vulnerable-share.tsx`

*   **Vulnerability:** The `pollTitle` prop in `app/(dashboard)/polls/vulnerable-share.tsx` was not sanitized before being embedded in share links, which could lead to reflected XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a user, would execute arbitrary JavaScript in their browser.
*   **Remediation:** The `pollTitle` is now properly encoded using `encodeURIComponent` before being used in the share links.

## General Security Recommendations

*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as those outlined in the OWASP Top 10.
*   **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their duties.
